== Morf DataSetConnector Showcase Application ==

=== Overview ===
A JavaFX application to demonstrate the capabilities of Morf's DataSetConnector, allowing users to configure data producers and consumers, and optionally manage database schemas.

=== Application Structure ===

==== Main Window Layout ====
The application should use a BorderPane layout with the following sections:

* '''Top''': Menu bar with File, Tools, and Help menus
* '''Centre''': Main configuration panel with tabs
* '''Bottom''': Status bar and progress indicator

==== Configuration Tabs ====

===== Producer Configuration Tab =====
* '''Type Selection''': ComboBox with all available DataSetProducer implementations:
** DatabaseDataSetProducer (for all supported databases)
** XmlDataSetProducer
** ExcelDataSetProducer
** Any other discovered implementations

* '''Connection Details Panel''': Dynamic form that changes based on selected producer type:
** For database producers: connection URL, username, password, driver selection
** For XML producers: file path selection
** For Excel producers: file path selection, worksheet options

* '''Schema Preview''': TreeView showing available tables and their structure

===== Consumer Configuration Tab =====
* '''Type Selection''': ComboBox with all available DataSetConsumer implementations:
** DatabaseDataSetConsumer (for all supported databases)
** XmlDataSetConsumer
** ExcelDataSetConsumer
** Any other discovered implementations

* '''Connection Details Panel''': Similar dynamic form as producer
* '''Options Panel''': Consumer-specific options (e.g., truncate tables, batch size)

===== Schema Management Tab =====
* '''Schema Adapter Options''':
** Checkbox: "Create missing tables in target"
** Checkbox: "Drop existing tables before creation"
** Checkbox: "Validate schema compatibility"

* '''Schema Comparison View''': Side-by-side comparison of source and target schemas
* '''Action Buttons''': 
** "Analyse Schema Differences"
** "Apply Schema Changes"

===== Execution Tab =====
* '''Transfer Configuration Summary''': Read-only display of current settings
* '''Progress Monitoring''':
** Overall progress bar
** Current table being processed
** Records transferred counter
** Elapsed time

* '''Log Output''': TextArea with scrollable log of operations
* '''Control Buttons''':
** "Start Transfer" (large, prominent button)
** "Cancel Transfer"
** "Save Configuration"
** "Load Configuration"

=== Key Features ===

==== Dynamic Producer/Consumer Discovery ====
Use reflection or service loading to discover all available DataSetProducer and DataSetConsumer implementations:

```java
// Discover implementations at runtime
List<Class<? extends DataSetProducer>> producerTypes = discoverProducerTypes();
List<Class<? extends DataSetConsumer>> consumerTypes = discoverConsumerTypes();
```
==== Database Support ====
Include configuration panels for all Morf-supported databases:
H2
MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle
SQL Server
Any others found in the codebase
==== Configuration Persistence ====
Save/load transfer configurations as JSON or XML files
Recent configurations menu
Default configuration templates
==== Error Handling and Validation ====
Real-time validation of connection parameters
Clear error messages with suggested solutions
Rollback capabilities for failed transfers
=== Implementation Considerations ===
==== Threading ====
Execute DataSetConnector operations on background threads
Use Platform.runLater() for UI updates
Provide cancellation support
==== Memory Management ====
Stream large datasets rather than loading entirely into memory
Progress reporting based on table count and estimated record counts
Configurable batch sizes for large transfers
==== User Experience ====
Wizard-style workflow for first-time users
Expert mode with all options visible
Tooltips and help text for complex options
Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
=== Menu Structure ===
==== File Menu ====

==== Tools Menu ====
