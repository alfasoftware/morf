# Product Overview

Morf is a Java library for cross-platform evolutionary relational database mechanics, database access, and database imaging/cloning.

## Core Capabilities

- **Evolutionary Database Design**: Bidirectional run-time verification of upgrades, bootstraps empty databases, manages complex data migration alongside schema changes
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Targets multiple database platforms (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, H2) without platform-specific scripting
- **Database Snapshots and Cloning**: Clone or dump full databases including schema and data, restore across different database platforms
- **Database Access API**: Runtime database access using the same DSL used in upgrades
- **Pure Java API**: No XML/JSON/YAML configuration required

## Project Status

Pre-alpha open source project. The library is proven technology used in production for many years at Alfa Financial Software, but the public API is still evolving and should be considered unstable.
